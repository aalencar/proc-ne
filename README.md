# Spaced-repetition flashcard-based system for learning Czech

- [What is spaced repetition?](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

### Project name 🧐
Czech is understood as a very hard to learn language, so the question "Why are you learning Czech" comes up a lot and my answer is "Proc ne?" which means "Why not?" in Czech.

### Why 🤔
- 🔨 Build a tool for myself to make the process of learning czech more pleasant
- 🔍 I want to brush up my skills and node.js, also learn more about Graphql.
- 😕 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a very popular tool for space-repetition learning but I didn't like the overall UX

### Stack
- React
- GraphQL
- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Roadmap 
- [ ] Flashcards
- [ ] Spaced-repetition system
- [ ] Natural Processing Language

### TODO
- [ ] Dockerize
- [ ] Publish
